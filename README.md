LR - Software Engineer Assignment 
========

As a software engineer working you will be work with code on day to day basis. It is very important to us that you produce working code which is tested and of high quality. This assignment consists of two parts: 1) extend existing application and 2) describe how this application would be deployed for a high availability (HA) scenario.

Part 1:
---

Firstly, get a copy of Polymer starter kit (PSK - [https://developers.google.com/web/tools/polymer-starter-kit/?hl=en](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/polymer-starter-kit/?hl=en) ). You should be able to quickly get this up and running as the instructions are available on the website and README file in the repository.

Your task is to get this sample running and extend it with one more section - “Reminders”. This section should have a list of reminders which user has entered as well as a way for users to add new reminders. When user wants to add a new reminder he/she should be able to enter a title for the reminder (e.g. Pick up groceries), more detailed description of the reminder (e.g. groceries are to be picked up at Coles in KX) as well as the due date (e.g. 17/07/2017). The user has to be able to save the reminder.

Once you’re ready to submit please send us a link to git repository where your code is located. The repository can either be public or private. In case it is private, please ensure we have access to it.

In a follow up interview we will discuss your code and approach as well as touch on topics of code quality, code maintainability and testing.

Part 2:
----

The above application needs to be deployed and served to a user base. The client has estimated that they expect about 20.000 users in an hour on “worst case” days (e.g. Xmas and New Years for example). On an average day they would have 1000 users during peak hours and around 200 users per hour otherwise. Describe how would you deploy this application catering for the above needs. If needed feel free to include diagrams. If you make any assumptions, please note down those. This is an open ended task so feel free to be as elaborate as you feel it’s necessary. There will be a follow on technical interview to discuss your approach and drill down into more details.
